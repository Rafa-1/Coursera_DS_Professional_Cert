# Coursera_DS_Professional_Cert
This is the capstone project repo for the Coursera DS Professional Certifcate.
This project requires framing a project using Foursquare with Python and other available libraries to explore neighborhoods. The selected topic is exploring neighborhoods in the vicinity of the SBK Metro Line stations in the Klang Valley, Malaysia. 1 km radius neighborhoods around alternate stations along the line are explored. Not the most efficient coding as I am a beginner but an enjoyable experience and stepping stone. Jupyter NB, Python, Pandas, Folium, Clustering, Visualizations with MatPlot were used. Another MRT line is being constructed. When completed, I hope to incorporate it into this with more sophistication.
